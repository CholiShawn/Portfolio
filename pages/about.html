        <h2>Starter facts</h2>
         <p>I’m still in highschool, in grade 11 as of writing this. 
        My hobbies include playing a variety of instruments, 
        reading, and playing video games (mostly animal crossing). 
        I really like animals (especially dogs) 
        and hiking at conservation areas.</p>

        <h2>What I aspire to be</h2>
         <p>Hopefully I can have a research profession in the world of Physics 
        <em>(preferably in astronomy)</em> because I’ve loved space and its wonders 
        for most of my life. The inspiration to want to pursue this career 
        actually came from my aunt who is a software engineer for the Hubble
        Space Telescope. This is actually why I’m taking these programming 
        classes in school, because one of the skills needed to pursue a career
         in these sciences is being able to code in a variety of languages 
         (mainly python). If this plan unfortunately falls out, my plan b would 
         lie somewhere in the chemistry field or even music.</p>

        <h2>Experience in Tech Related Matters</h2>
         <p>I don’t know much about computers, however I did once learn how to code 
        in Python and I created a little pokemon-battle type game with it back 
        in middle school (around grade 7 or 8). The amount of information I’ve 
        retained from back then is unknown but that’s about it. I also am aware 
        of how computers work and I do play a lot of games on consoles as well as 
        have knowledge on the process of creating video games</p>
